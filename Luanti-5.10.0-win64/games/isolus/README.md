# Isolus

The name refers to a powerful being whose dream you're participating.

Beware of the Luanti community, most are not good friends.

The edited mods ( which are meant to be used with Isolus ) are of varying quality,
some are overhauled and others tweaked, I tried to fix/revise them.

Also see the [Minetest Wiki](https://wiki.minetest.net/Subgames/Minetest_Game) for more origin information.
