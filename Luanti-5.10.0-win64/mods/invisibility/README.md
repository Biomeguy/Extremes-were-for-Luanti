Invisibility Potion by TenPlus1

This mod lets you craft an invisibility potion using one of each sapling (tree, jungle, pine, acacia, aspen, bush, acacia bush), a red mushroom and glass bottle.

Use potion to hide yourself AND nametag (0.4.15+ only) for 3 minutes.

Server admin can use the '/vanish <name>' command to hide/unhide players or themselves by leaving it blank.
