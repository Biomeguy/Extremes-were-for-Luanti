# Send Duplicate
Adds two commands to Luanti which enables you to send what you are currently holding to another player's inventory, or duplicate it for accurate doubles.

## Usage
`/sendstack <playername>`

Takes what you are holding and sends it to `playername`, setting the stack you are holding to what couldn't be added to the player's inventory (none if all was added, partial stack if partially added and a full stack if none was added)
