Isolus: Notes
=============

The new drawtypes and wavings are;	"grasslike" 1 ( param2 only rotates 0 to 3 ),
"plantpoof" 1, "reedlike" 1, "leafdroop" 1&2, "leafpoof" 1&2.


Couldn’t complete temperature and humidity limits for plants, slowing melting in cool biomes and other thermal things,
because I don’t understand how they’re generated on the map.
These are demonstrated with farming: ( blueberry and turmuric ).

Couldn’t revise technic radiation resistance list,
because I don’t know how these values are estimated, especially for fictional materials.

Trunks and trunk-likes aren't breakable by hand, barkless wooden objects are.

Tree saplings can be grown from their fruit, nut or seed.

New trees eat some dirt.

Rocks are (stone ingots) for basic grinding, making tools and rockblocks.

Torches burnout eventually.

Mortar and pestle are often used for liquid and fine solid extraction, can also be used for rough solids with group:grinder.

Bolders were thrown by volcanos from deep under ground and have ores.

Cashes are meant to replace dungeons and compensate for the ores removed by the Morlendor and/or Nether.

Foods larger than the mouth have an eating/swallowing sound else nothing.

Producers are tweaked traders with a few new features ((
Tries to stay near wood,
Breedable with the foods they follow,
Sneak right clicking with swords can improve the producer's defences if greater than their own (drops it when they die),
Right clicking with E or feeding lets them wander,
With hbhunger they can die of hunger if certain crops aren't in reach, see trader house and which foods they follow)),
the last one is unrealistic for infinite trades which can include food,
but there's no easy way to check if so (before defining the shop), and I wanted them to need something nearby.
